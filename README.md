We will start by adding splash screen in our APP first and then followed by Intro Slider. Splash screen is the first thing that the user sees when app is launched. It is timed and user is directed to the home activity after that. During the splash screen display we can do background processing like loading data for that user etc.  

We will make an Intro slider and splash screen for a demo camera app. We will use **Viewpager Class** and a **Viewpager adapter** to display Slides of Intro slider.
